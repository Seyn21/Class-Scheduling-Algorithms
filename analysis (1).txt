Analysis of Class Scheduling Algorithms

Input:
Courses: CSC2201 with priority 2 for 3 hours preferred to start first,
         CSC3401 with priority 3 for 2 hours preferred to start second,
         CSC1103 with priority 1 for 1 hour preferred to start third.

Output:
FCFS Order of Scheduling: 2201 3401 1103
Average Waiting Time: 2.0
Average Turnaround Time: 4.0

Priority Scheduling Order of Scheduling: 1103 2201 3401
Average Waiting Time: 1.0
Average Turnaround Time: 3.0

Explanation:
- FCFS (First-Come, First-Served) scheduling is straightforward but does not consider priority. It schedules classes based on the order they appear.
- Priority Scheduling takes into account the priority of each class, leading to potentially lower waiting and turnaround times for higher-priority classes.
- In the given example, Priority Scheduling results in a lower average waiting time and turnaround time compared to FCFS, making it more efficient for this scenario.

Conclusion:
Priority Scheduling is better suited for this class scheduling problem as it considers the importance of each class, leading to better overall efficiency in terms of waiting and turnaround times.
